    "description": "Thundrake, an adolescent Elemental Dragon with an innate affinity to storms, was forged in the heart of a sky forge hidden within stormy mountain peaks during the fiercest storm the world had ever seen. This large, majestic creature thrives in its tumultuous habitat, manipulating lightning, controlling weather, and summoning storms with ease. Its sleek, serpentine body glows with an ethereal blue light, especially when it unleashes its formidable electromagnetic pulse. Thundrake's curious and intelligent nature led it to form a bond with Kody, a tech-savvy scientist who discovered the hidden sky forge during a research expedition. Their mutual respect and curiosity forged an unbreakable connection, with Kody fascinated by Thundrake's abilities and Thundrake intrigued by Kody's technological prowess. Despite its formidable strengths, including high voltage resistance, rapid healing in storms, and enhanced intelligence, Thundrake must be cautious of grounding, overexertion, and high temperatures, which can weaken its powers. Its hasty nature and energetic mood keep it constantly on the move, levitating even in its sleep, while it lives by the motivational words of Benjamin Spock: \"Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.\" This rare and uncommon Echo, with its impressive base stats and echo values, embodies the perfect synergy of nature and technology, as evidenced by its seamless partnership with Kody.",
    "lore": "**Thundrake: The Sky's Whisper**\n\n**Lore:**\nThundrake, a majestic Echo, was birthed amidst the fury of nature itself. Forged in a hidden sky forge nestled within the unyielding peaks of the Stormspine Mountains, Thundrake emerged during the cataclysmic tempest known as the Tempest's Wrath. This storm, the fiercest the world had ever witnessed, was said to be a manifestation of the ancient sky gods' anger and sorrow.\n\nThe sky forge, a relic of forgotten celestial architects, harnessed the raw power of the storm to create Thundrake. With scales that shimmer like lightning and eyes that reflect the stormy skies, Thundrake embodies the tempest's dual nature\u2014destructive yet rejuvenating, chaotic yet orderly.\n\n**Companion:**\nKody, a brilliant and tech-savvy scientist, discovered the sky forge during a research expedition. His quest to meld nature with technology led him to the Stormspine Mountains, where the Tempest's Wrath had left traces of immense energy. Kody's curiosity and respect for the natural world allowed him to form a bond with Thundrake. Together, they symbolize the harmony between the organic and the mechanical, the ancient and the modern.\n\n**Cultural Significance:**\nThundrake holds a revered place in the folklore of the surrounding regions. Villagers and scholars alike tell tales of the Echo's birth, often",

Introduction\n\nIn the vast, primordial expanse of the Echoverse, where the raw essence of elemental forces meld with celestial energies, there exists a being of unparalleled majesty and power: Thundrake, the Echo of Tempest.
